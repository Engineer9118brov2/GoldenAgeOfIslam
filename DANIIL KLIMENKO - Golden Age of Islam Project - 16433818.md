Introduction: The Golden Age of Islam experienced during the Medieval era has greatly impacted the world we live in today. Many of the inventions, discoveries and achievements that Muslim scientists and scholars made during that time have been pivotal to the development of our modern world.

Directions: Working independently, you will choose **3 specific achievements** of the Muslim civilization during its Golden Age to focus on. You will then describe each achievement and explain its importance in our world today.   

 Step 1: Choose what achievements/inventions/discoveries you want to focus on **from the list below.**  Remember to pick 3 specific achievements from different categories. I suggest you choose things you are interested in.

* Achievements in Mathematics  
* Achievements in different areas of Science and Technology (Astronomy, Zoology, etc.)   
* Achievements in Medicine, Medical Knowledge, and Surgery  
* Achievements in Art(Architecture)   
* Achievements in Literature

 Step 2: Decide what format you will use for your project:

Possible Options: 

* Brochure/Booklet  
* Poster  
* Website  
* Video  
* Google Slides  
* Canva\*  
* Etc.-- If you have an idea that is not listed above, clear it with me before you begin\!

 Step 3:  Begin researching information for your project:  

The following information must be included in your final project. Make sure you paraphrase your research- no copying and pasting. Keep a list of your sources for step 4\!

1\.  Each achievement/discovery/invention and a detailed description about it.

- Provide detailed information about the achievement and its creation/use.  
- When did it develop or happen?  Who was involved in developing it?  How did it develop? Did it build off ideas from other civilizations ideas from another civilization (like the Greeks, India, etc)?    
- Include pictures, illustrations, or examples that show this achievement or invention.  

2\.  Each achievement/discovery/invention’s impact on the world today.

- Explain how this development has been part of a larger legacy or lasting impact.  
- How has this achievement changed or improved since the Medieval era? What has the achievement led to in the modern world?  
- Provide specific examples of this achievement or invention today.  Is it used or influential in daily life? What would life be like without it?  

Step 4: Put your final project together:

Put your information together in your chosen project format. It is up to you how you do it. Include a works cited page\! Simply list the name of the websites used **and** provide a link on a Google Doc or at the end of your slideshow if you chose Google Slides. We will be working on this project in class for a few days, after that, it will be homework. This is not something that can be put together in two class periods and receive a passing score. You must clearly demonstrate that you used class time wisely and worked to your full potential to do well. 

 You will work on this in class on Friday, Monday, and Tuesday. After that, you need to complete the project for homework.
