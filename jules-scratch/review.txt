**Medicine Section Impact:**

"The Canon of Medicine" was revolutionary. It introduced the idea of quarantine to prevent the spread of contagious diseases—a concept we still use today to stop illnesses from spreading. Ibn Sina also created a systematic way to test new drugs, which was an early form of the clinical trials that are essential for modern medicine. Without his work, doctors might not have understood the importance of hygiene, diet, and testing medicines safely. Life would be very different, as we would lack some of the basic medical rules that keep us healthy and help us recover from sickness.

**Mathematics Section Impact:**

Al-Khwarizmi's work was so influential that his name gave us the word "algorithm"—the set of instructions that powers computer programs. Every time you use GPS to find a location, watch a movie with computer-animated graphics, or play a video game, you are seeing algebra in action. Without his achievements, the technology we rely on for everything from online shopping to exploring space wouldn't exist. Can you imagine a day without your phone or computer? That's a world without algebra.

**Literature Section Impact:**

The influence of "The Thousand and One Nights" is immense. It has been translated into almost every language and continues to inspire new stories. For example, the famous Disney movie "Aladdin" is based on one of its tales, and the adventures of "Sinbad the Sailor" have been turned into multiple films. These stories of magic, love, and adventure have become a part of global culture. They are a powerful reminder of how a collection of stories from the Islamic Golden Age can continue to capture the imagination of people all over the world, teaching us that a good story is timeless.
